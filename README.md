Got it 👍 Let me rewrite your **README.md** in a **more natural, human-written style** (not robotic).

# 🤖 GrievBot – Ask Me Anything Chatbot

GrievBot is a simple chatbot built with **Python and Flask** that can answer almost any question by pulling information directly from **Wikipedia**.
It’s lightweight, easy to run, and a great way to see how a web app can combine a frontend chat interface with a backend knowledge source.

---

## 🛠️ What I Used

* **Python** – main programming language
* **Flask** – backend web framework
* **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – for the chat interface
* **Wikipedia API (python-wikipedia)** – to fetch answers in real time
* **VS Code** – for coding and debugging
* (Optional) **Render / Heroku** – if you want to deploy it online

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. Open the chatbot in your browser.
2. Type in a question, like *“What is Artificial Intelligence?”*.
3. The frontend (`index.html` + `script.js`) sends your question to the Flask backend.
4. Flask (`app.py`) searches Wikipedia for the answer.
5. You’ll get back a short, clear response (usually 1–2 sentences).

If the bot can’t find a page, it will either suggest related topics or tell you it couldn’t find an answer.

## ⚙️ How to Run It

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Grievbot.git
   cd Grievbot/project
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv

   # Windows (PowerShell)
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

   # macOS / Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r ../requirements.txt
   ```

   (If requirements.txt is missing, just run `pip install flask wikipedia`.)

4. Start the Flask app:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to:
      [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](https://p4mw653s-5000.inc1.devtunnels.ms/)
